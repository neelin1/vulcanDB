Why should we spend 62k and more than that for iPhones because of it's brand and Acessories comfort size and Features right if that's not there what's point of buying an iPhone.Thank you🙏    Reviewed in India on 11 August 2024

The screen is a dark and blurry aftermarket product that is far from the original. The battery is at 80%. I don't know what's so good about it. The quality is poor for this price.
